### Environment variables

- `VITE_VERIFIER_ID` - id of the verifier registered with the verifier registry
- `VITE_SOURCES_REGISTRY` / `VITE_SOURCES_REGISTRY_TESTNET` - sources registry to fetch data from
- `VITE_BACKEND_URL` / `VITE_BACKEND_URL_TESTNET` - urls for backend (split by comma)

## Running

- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`

## Appendix: Adding new FunC versions

1. Add the wasm binding in package json, as such:

```
"func-js-bin-0.4.3": "npm:@ton-community/func-js-bin@^0.4.3",
```

2. Add the version to https://github.com/ton-community/contract-verifier-config
