path: # optional
# A glob pattern that matches the artifacts to download. Ignored if name is specified.

Multiple merge: # Optional, defaults to false
# The GitHub token used to authenticate with the GitHub API. This is required when downloading artifacts from a different repository or from a different workflow execution. If this is not specified, the action will attempt to download artifacts from the current repository and the current workflow execution.

# The repository owner and repository name, joined by "/". If github-token is specified, this is the repository from which the artifacts will be downloaded.
Repository: # Optional, defaults to ${{ github.repository }}
